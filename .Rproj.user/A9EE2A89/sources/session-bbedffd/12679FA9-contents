subtitle: "An open science community you'll want to hang out with"
description: "Sit down, relax, join us and get to know our Agape community. We are a small group of early career researchers (ECRs) wanted to create an open science community for open science enthusiasts with a specific focus on ECRs. We set out to create a community that is open, transparent, inclusive and beginners friendly. We want to help introduce yourself to the open science world and be the stepping stone to a more transparent, accessible and reproducible research practising world."
