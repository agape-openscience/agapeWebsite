## An introductory course to open science for early career researchers

---

The MOOC is developed as an independent work under Agape initiative.  This is the first project of Agape and we focused on the creation of a massive online open course (MOOC) created by early career researchers (ECRs) for ECRs and other academics. The content of the MOOC is reviewed and beta-tested. The current version was launched in February 2023.

This book is created using **R Markdown** and **bookdown**.

More details regarding the template and resources developed for this mooc is listed under open source resources.
