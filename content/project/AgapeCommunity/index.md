### “A community for PhDs and ECRs”

---

The project is developed as an independent work under Agape initiative.  Under the Agape initiative, we aim to get involved with early career researchers (ECRs) in Ireland in the open science movement and to build an open science practicing community.  Main activities include the creation of an introductory course to open science for early career researchers, setting and maintaining a platform where questions can be asked and opinions and information shared as a tool to empowering the community, creation of a blog site and website for the Agape community, series of workshops for ECRs, and development of open source resources
