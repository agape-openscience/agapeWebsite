Under Agape, we aim to disseminate open science between PhD students and early career researchers across Ireland, and eventually take this mission internationally. We want to create a safe open science practising community for early career researchers where we can learn, exchange our opinions and experiences, and together change the future of science. We aim to do this in the way that science is undertaken, made freely available, and communicated in a FAIR and transparent way.
