Thank you to all the folks who have developed the Hugo Theme. 

The fools who contributed both technical and creative skills to this project are: 

+ [Agape Team :otter:](https://github.com/agape-openscience/) 


To be added...

And last but not least, Eric Anderson and the team at [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for developing a Hugo theme with such great bones: <https://github.com/formspree/blogophonic-hugo>
